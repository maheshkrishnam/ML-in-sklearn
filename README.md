# ML in sklearn
- This repo include some of the code and it's best practices that I have done during my ML learning

## This repo following ML Algorithms :
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient boosting
6. XGBoost
7. K-Mean
8. DBSCAN
9. PCA

## All the Models goes through mainly these processes:
- Business Requirements
- Problem Identification
- Data Loading
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Imputation and Scaling of Data
- Baseline Model
- Perform Feature Engineering
- Train and Evaluate Different Models
- Hyperparameters tuning for the best suitable Models
- Ensembling on Best Models
- Testing Model on Test data
- Interpretation and Presentation
